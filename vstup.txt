“Rip van Winkle” is a short story written by Washington Irving in 1819. Its main protagonist, Rip van Winkle, living at the foot of the Appalachian mountains, in a small town called Catskill.
As far as we talk about Rip´s physical appearance, he is presented as a simply-minded villager living in his homely rural house with his family. But when we consider his personality, it is more complicated. In this way Rip is meant to be a helpful, honest man who is popular in the neighbourhood. What is more, he is also a henpecked husband who, however, has a mistake; he always refuses to do hard work because he finds it necessary.
And this is actually the reason of the main conflict here. Rip´s rejection to hard work makes his wife angry and he has to listen to her disappointed speeches quite often.
In my point of view, Rip had the most important relationship with dog, as we can see him as some kind of his partner when he is leaving home before his reproachfully-speaking mad wife. Finally, we can see some hints of his relationship to nature. Nature is presented in the story as his place to hide before the people, so he can be on his own.
